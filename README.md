[pyspatialfield](#pyspatialfield): Analyse structures in spatial data by spatial moments.
[pycomponents](#pycomponents): Analyse structures in datasets by principal components analysis.


## pyspatialfield

This is a python package for studying properties of 2D data structures, scalar field-like data, by means of spatial moments.

The package can be used in image processing, and to manage one or several features in an image field.


## pycomponents

This packages contains implementations of the *principal components* techniques, which enable description and reduction of complex data with simple geometric structures.   

### Examples

Examples are available as Jupyter notebooks in [example1.ipynb](example1.ipynb).
