This is a collection of data reduction and analysis routines.  

[pyspatialfield](#pyspatialfield): Analyse structures in spatial data by spatial moments.

[pycomponents](#pycomponents): Analyse structures in datasets by principal components analysis.


## pyspatialfield

This is a python package for studying properties of 2D data structures, scalar field-like data, by means of spatial moments.

The package can be used in image processing, and to manage one or several features in an image field.


## pycomponents

This packages contains implementations of the *principal components* techniques, which enable description and reduction of complex data with simple geometric structures.   

## Installation

Dependencies are defined in `requirements.txt`. When using a virtual environment, dependencies can be installed with `pip install -r requirements`. 

Python version: Minimum requirements: >= 3.9. Recommended > 3.11.4

## Examples

Examples are available as Jupyter notebooks in [example_principal_components.ipynb](example_principal_components.ipynb) and [example_spatial_field.ipynb](example_spatial_field.ipynb).
